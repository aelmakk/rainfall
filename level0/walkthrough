* In this level0 we are dealing with a 32-bit executable  
* I used gdb to explore the memory : 

* first the program compare the first argument passed to the program with the value 423.
* if the value is different the program prints "No !\n", and return .
* othewise if the first argument is equal to 423, it calls geteuid and geteuid, then set  the EUID and EGID
* call the function execv with /bin/sh as a parameter which gives shell with level1 permission since the setuid bit is set .
* tried 423 as arg to level0 file and got a shell 
* i run cat /home/user/level1/.pass , and got the flag
