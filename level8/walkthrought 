* In this level8 the program start by printing two pointers auth, service
* than reads 128  bytes from the user , and checks whether it start with one of the bellow command:
* "auth ": in this case the program ccpy using strcpy() the remaining of buff (buff + 5) to the allocated memory .
* "reset" : it frees the auth struct.
* "service" : it dumplicate the remaining of buff (buff + 7) .
* "login": if buff start with login it checks if the memory address at auth + 32 is zero (if yes it asks for a password , if not it calls system("/bin/sh")).

==> the goal is to change the memory address at (auth + 32 ) to do that :
* auth AAAA
* service AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA // to change the memory at (auth + 32)
* login // amazing we got a shell
